<h1>Brontosaurus</h1>
<p>
Brontosaurus (thunder lizard) is a long necked quadruped whose existence
was debated for a long time, with original finds being found to be
composed of different animals. In 2015 the name was resurrected after
an extensive study showed that there was a distinction between it and
its cousin the Apatosaurus.
